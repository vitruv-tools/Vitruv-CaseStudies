# MediaStore incremental test cases:
----------

1) Packages for the repository and its contained components.

2) + Empty classes and interfaces for all components and component interfaces.

3) + Classes and properties for CompositeDataTypes and their inner declarations.

4) + Operations with parameters for interface operation signatures.

5) + Interface implementation for provided roles.

6) + Properties, constructors and operations (both with parameters) for required roles.
TODO

7) + Classes inheriting from Collection types and multi-valued properties for CollectionDataTypes.
TODO
* The MediaStore PCM repository doesn't actually contain CollectionDataTypes..

8) + Classes with properties and constructors for CompositeComponents and their AssemblyContexts.
TODO
* The MediaStore PCM repository doesn't actually contain CompositeComponents..
