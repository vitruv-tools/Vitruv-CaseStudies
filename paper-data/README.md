# Data for SSP Paper

This directory contains the data for the SSP paper. The following files / directory contain the following data:
* `raw-data.json` / `raw-data.csv` contains the raw measured data. The CSV file is used as input for the R scripts. Every measurement series is identified by the server configuration, client configuration, and communication path (*controller* for a run on $S_2$ only, *worker* for a run on $S_1$ only, *controller-to-worker* for $S_2$ as client and $S_1$ as server, *worker-to-controller* for $S_1$ as client and $S_2$ as server). *pre* are measurements taken before the actual execution to reduce the warmup phase.
* `analysis-scripts/` contains the R scripts to analyze the raw data.
* `eval-results.json` contains the raw results from the analysis.
* `plots/` contains plots generated by the R scripts for every single measurement series.
* `all-line.pdf` contains a plot with all measurement data in chronological order.
